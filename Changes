Revision history for Perl extension Tie::DB_Lock.

0.01 Tue May 26 16:27:27 1998
   - original version; created by h2xs 1.18

   - I had omitted a file (db/README) from MANIFEST,
     that made "make test" fail.  The code was still
     fully operational, but the test failed.

   - cpan-testers report that 'make test' fails test 4,5,6 on Irix.
     I'm not sure why, so I've added a 'verbose' mode to 'make test',
     and one more test (#4) that may shed some light.  Do "make test
     TEST_VERBOSE=1" to try it.  None of the real functionality of the
     module is different in this release.

   - Apparently cpan-testers can't get the tests to pass on 
     i86pc-solaris 2.6 either.  The error shown under TEST_VERBOSE=1
     is "Bad file number."  Perhaps this has something to do with
     the FileHandle package.  I've added a VERY_VERBOSE=1 test flag that
	  should help track the problem further - it just sets the variable
	  $Tie::DB_Lock::VERBOSE to 1.
